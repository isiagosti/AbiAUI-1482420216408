# ABI for SACRE

ABI is a companion robot for the elderly, that uses reading to relax them and stimulate their imagination and creativity.
He can read books of any genre (i.e. fantasy, romantic, thriller) and present the latest news.
If one wants to stop the reading halfway through a book, ABI is able to keep a bookmark and restart from where he left when he is asked to read the same book. Also, if the user asks him to, he can change his voice (male or female) and language (Italian and English are available) at any time during the conversation.
